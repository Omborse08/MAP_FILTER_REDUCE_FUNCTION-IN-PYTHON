# ðŸŽ“ Student Result Analyzer (Python)

This is a mini Python project that uses **functional programming** tools like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` to analyze student exam scores.

---

## ðŸ§  What it does:

ðŸ”¹ Converts student marks to grades using a custom grading system:
- A â†’ 90 and above  
- B â†’ 75â€“89  
- C â†’ 60â€“74  
- D â†’ 40â€“59  
- F â†’ Below 40  

ðŸ”¹ Filters out students who passed (marks â‰¥ 40)

ðŸ”¹ Calculates the average of the passed students using `reduce()`

---

## ðŸ›  Concepts Used:

- `map()` â€“ to assign grades
- `filter()` â€“ to select passed students
- `reduce()` â€“ to calculate average
- `round()` â€“ for cleaner output formatting

---

## ðŸ“¦ Example Input:
```
marks = [45, 67, 89, 38, 90, 74, 50, 32]
```

## âœ… Example Output:
```
Students Grades: ['D', 'C', 'B', 'F', 'A', 'C', 'D', 'F']
Passed Students: [45, 67, 89, 90, 74, 50]
Total Avg Is: 69.17
```

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This

I wanted to understand how functional programming works in Python using real-world-style data.  
This helped me write cleaner code without loops and improve my logic-building skills.
